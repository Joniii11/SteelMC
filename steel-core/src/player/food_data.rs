//! Player food/hunger system.
//!
//! Manages food level, saturation, and exhaustion — the three values that
//! control natural health regeneration and starvation damage.
//!
//! The tick logic mirrors vanilla `FoodData.tick()` exactly:
//! 1. Exhaustion above 4.0 drains saturation first, then food level.
//! 2. Natural regeneration (gated by the `naturalRegeneration` game rule):
//!    - **Fast regen**: food = 20 AND saturation > 0 → heal every 10 ticks.
//!    - **Slow regen**: food ≥ 18 → heal 1 HP every 80 ticks.
//! 3. Starvation: food = 0 → 1 damage every 80 ticks (threshold depends on
//!    difficulty).
